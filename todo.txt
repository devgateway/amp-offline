1. Upgrade webpack to v4. Current version of webpack loads an uglifyjs version that can't process ES code. Some libraries are using ES syntax and cause trouble while minifying.

electron 1.4.4 is old. app does not start without showing any error.

remote functionality was removed in electron v14. see: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21408
trying to use electron v13.
